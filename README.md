## Introduction

Made as part of the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Meet the 15 user stories in [the brief](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page).

- User Story 1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

- User Story 2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

- User Story 3: Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

- User Story 4: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

- User Story 5: When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

- User Story 6: I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

- User Story 7: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

- User Story 8: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

- User Story 9: The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

- User Story 10: The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

- User Story 11: Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

- User Story 12: When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

- User Story 13: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

- User Story 14: My product landing page should have at least one media query.

- User Story 15: My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.


### Personal Aims

Practice what I know about creating good landing pages. Create a page that looks more professional than what I've produced before.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy!

### Prerequisites: None

### Running: Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- codepen.io/FCC: Test Suite Template

I used VSC and Chrome Devtools to compile my code. Then copied the <body> and CSS into the codepen test suite.

Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.

I brushed up on design and took inspiration from the examples in [his landing page guide](https://neilpatel.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-landing-pages/).


## Author Notes

I created a fictional company (Madeupco) and product (essentially help to become successful) for this project.

When it came to drafting testimonials I searched for a name generator and found one for pirates. Thus the testimonials ended up being for pirates. I might look to make the project fully pirate themed someday but for the time being my priority is making it functional.

I'm fairly happy with the design, I know I can still make it look even better as I learn more but it's a good effort so far and serves its purpose.

It should be responsive (I've tested it) but if you notice any issues please let me know.

A landing page should be simple and direct the user where you want them to go. This is fairly easy to achieve with the project as you are limited to one page anyway. I personally wouldn't normally add a video to one but it was required in the brief.
