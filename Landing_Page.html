          <h3>Carla Vastparrot</h3>
          <h4>Captain on The Festering Fall</h4>
          <p>Times were tough for my smuggling business. I wasn't sure how to turn it from stern to bow and even thought about jumping overboard and becoming a farmer or something. Then one day, when gazing through my telescope from the crows nest, I noticed a board promoting Madeupco. I swiftly got in touch with them and within a couple of months I was running a successful ship. It's been 3 years since, with Madeupco by my side the whole time, and now I've treasure buried on every island for 1000 miles.</p>

          <h3>Alannah Greyhate</h3>
          <h4>HR Manager on The Damned Minnow</h4>
          <p>After receiving the black spot, during post-work drinks one Friday night, I realised I needed to lead a better life. Back then I was just your average first mate with mediocre cutlass skills. But thanks to Madeupco I found my true calling as HR Manager for the ship and am leading my dream life. If the curse of the spot gets me tomorrow at least I know I've lived my best life!</p>

          <h3>Martin Greenbeard</h3>
          <h4>First Mate on The Howling Return</h4>
          <p>I used to be a fisherman and it was tough; long hours, low pay and I got my boots wet most days. I contacted Madeupco and asked them to help me reach my true calling. Their expert guidance quickly got me skilling up and soon I found an entry level job on a pirate ship. With Madeupco helping, I've been working my way up ever since and someday I'll be captain I'm sure. It's all thanks to them, you guys are the best Madeupco!</p>
